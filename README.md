Project Description

The Incident Response and Digital Forensics Playbook project focuses on building and simulating the complete incident response lifecycle. It is designed to provide practical experience in handling cyber incidents through structured phases: preparation, detection, analysis, containment, eradication, recovery, and post-incident activities.

Throughout the project, a simulated environment is used to practice responding to security events such as phishing and ransomware attacks. Participants define team roles, set up communication and response procedures, collect forensic evidence, perform root cause analysis, and document recovery steps.

The final outcome includes a comprehensive Incident Response Playbook, evidence collection and analysis, technical and executive reports, and a lessons-learned presentation. This project strengthens both technical and organizational skills required for effective cybersecurity incident handling.

⚡ Key Highlights:

 1.Incident Response Team (IRT) setup and role definition.
 2.Incident simulation with forensic evidence collection.
 3.Root cause analysis and recovery planning.
 4.Development of IR playbook, reports, and presentations.
 5.Hands-on approach to real-world incident handling scenarios.
