The Incident Response and Digital Forensics Playbook project simulates the full incident response lifecycle. It covers preparation, simulation of attacks (phishing, ransomware), evidence collection, root cause analysis, containment, recovery, and post-incident reporting. Final deliverables include an IR playbook, reports, and lessons learned.
